Optional variable `selfTouchValid` sets whether polygons using
**self-touching rings** to form holes are reported as valid. If this
flag is set, the following self-touching conditions are treated as
being valid:

* The shell ring self-touches to create a hole touching the shell
* A hole ring self-touches to create two holes touching at a point

The default of `0` (following the OGC SFS standard) is that this
condition is not valid. Set it to `1` to consider it valid (c.f.
ESRI SDE model).
