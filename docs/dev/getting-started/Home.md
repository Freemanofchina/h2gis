H2GIS is a spatial extension of the [H2](http://www.h2database.com/) database
engine in the spirit of [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/). It adds support for
managing spatial features and operations including `(M)Polygon`,
`(M)LineString` and `(M)Point` types, the [Open Geospatial
Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org/) (OGC) [Simple Features for
SQL](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs) (SFSQL) functions and
additional spatial functions that we (the [Atelier SIG](http://www.irstv.fr/))
develop.
